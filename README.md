# Advent

Contains solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems written in Crystal

Advent of Code is my favorite way to learn a new language.

The problems are fun and interesting while also forcing me to learn practical parts of a language:
- types: int, string, array, map, big-int, structs, classes
- reading from files
- writing to output
- testing: I try to follow TDD it suits Advent of Code very well
- performance: most coding challenges allow for brute force at first, but n becomes large quickly
